# Behavioural_malware_detection_in_Delay_Tolerant_Networks
Created a system to detect malware in delay tolerant networks(DTN) using ‘Naive Bayes spam filtering’ algorithm.
This project aims on inter-region routing on both probabilistic and deterministic forwarding mechanisms embedded in an architectural framework.
